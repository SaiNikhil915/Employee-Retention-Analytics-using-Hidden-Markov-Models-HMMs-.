Employee retention analytics with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is like having a
crystal ball to understand why employees might leave a job. Picture it as a smart
detective analyzing information about how employees perform, how long they've
been part of the company, their feedback, and other important details. HMMs help
by breaking down employees' situations into different "states," like content or
thinking of moving on. This method allows companies to see how likely it is for
someone to switch from one state to another. Using this insight, organizations can
step in early, offering extra support or tailored solutions to keep their team happier
and motivated.

Ultimately, this approach helps companies make smarter decisions to retain valuable
employees for the long haul. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a statistical tool
used to understand sequences of observations where an underlying process is not
directly observable. In the context of employee retention, HMMs help by modelling
different "hidden states" that employees might be in, such as satisfied, dissatisfied,
or considering leaving. These states are not directly seen but are inferred from
observable features like performance ratings, tenure, absenteeism, or engagement
levels.
